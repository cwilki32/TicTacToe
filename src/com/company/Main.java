//        Create a tic tac toe game
//        The game should display the “board” grid in the console
//        The game should allow a user to choose where to put their mark on the board (x’s or o’s)
//        The game should have the computer place their mark after a player’s turn
//        The game should check for 3 in a row marks to declare a winner
//        The game should determine randomly if the player is using x’s or o’s as their mark
//        Whoever (player or computer) is assigned x’s should play first
//        The game should ask you to play again once complete
//        The game should track your wins and loses
//        The game should detect a tie when the board is full but there is no winner
